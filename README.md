## About this sample

### Overview

In this sample, the native client and a simple JavaScript single page application:

1. Acquire a token to act On Behalf Of the user.
2. Call a web API (`TodoListService`)
3. Which itself calls another downstream Web API (The Microsoft Graph)

The TodoListService uses a database to:

- Store the todo list
- Illustrate [token cache serialization](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Token-cache-serialization) in a service

   ![Topology](./ReadmeFiles/Topology.png)

### Scenario. How the sample uses ADAL.NET (and ADAL.js)

- `TodoListClient` uses  Active Directory Authentication Library for .NET (ADAL.NET) to acquire a token for the user in order to call the first web API. For more information about how to acquire tokens interactively, see [Acquiring tokens interactively Public client application flows](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Acquiring-tokens-interactively---Public-client-application-flows).
- `TodoListSPA`, the single page application, uses [ADAL.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js). When the user enters a todo item, `TodoListClient` and `TodoListSPA` call `TodoListService`  on the `/todolist` endpoint.
- Then `TodoListService` also uses ADAL.NET  to get a token to act on behalf of the user to call the Microsoft Graph. For details, see [Service to service calls on behalf of the user](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Service-to-service-calls-on-behalf-of-the-user). It then decorates the todolist item entered by the user, with the First name and the Last name of the user. Below is a screen copy of what happens when the user named *automation service account* entered "item1" in the textbox.

Both flows use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to obtain the tokens. For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload)
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-onbehalfof.git`

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet pacakges, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are three projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- either follow the steps in the paragraphs below ([Step 2](#step-2--register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3](#step-3--configure-the-sample-to-use-your-azure-ad-tenant))
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** create for you the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies)
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation, read the instructions in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

#### First step: choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the top bar, click on your account, and then on **Switch Directory**. 
1. Once the *Directory + subscription* pane opens, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application, from the *Favorites* or *All Directories* list.
1. Click on **All services** in the left-hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.

> In the next steps, you might need the tenant name (or directory name) or the tenant ID (or directory ID). These are presented in the **Properties**
of the Azure Active Directory window respectively as *Name* and *Directory ID*

#### Register the service app (TodoListService-OBO)

1. In the  **Azure Active Directory** pane, click on **App registrations** and choose **New application registration**.
1. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListService-OBO' and select 'Web app / API' as the *Application Type*.
1. For the *sign-on URL*, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44321/`.
1. Click on **Create** to create the application.
1. In the succeeding page, Find the *Application ID* value and copy it to the clipboard. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Then click on **Settings**, and choose **Properties**.
1. For the App ID URI, replace the guid in the generated URI 'https://\<your_tenant_name\>/\<guid\>', with the name of your service, for example, 'https://\<your_tenant_name\>/TodoListService-OBO' (replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant)
1. From the Settings menu, choose **Keys** and add a new entry in the Password section:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you save this page, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. Configure Permissions for your application. To that extent, in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section and then,
   click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and type `Microsoft Graph` in the textbox. Then, click on  **Select Permissions** and select **Sign in and read user profile**.

#### Register the client app (TodoListClient-OBO)

1. In the  **Azure Active Directory** pane, click on **App registrations** and choose **New application registration**.
1. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListClient-OBO' and select 'Native' as the *Application Type*.
1. For the *Redirect URI*, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListClient-OBO`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Click on **Create** to create the application.
1. In the succeeding page, Find the *Application ID* value and copy it to the clipboard. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Then click on **Settings**, and choose **Properties**.
1. Configure Permissions for your application. To that extent, in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section and then,
   click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and type `TodoListService-OBO` in the textbox. Then, click on  **Select Permissions** and select **Access 'TodoListService-OBO'**.

#### Register the spa app (TodoListSPA-OBO)

1. In the  **Azure Active Directory** pane, click on **App registrations** and choose **New application registration**.
1. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListSPA-OBO' and select 'Web app / API' as the *Application Type*.
1. For the *sign-on URL*, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `http://localhost:16969/`.
1. Click on **Create** to create the application.
1. In the succeeding page, Find the *Application ID* value and copy it to the clipboard. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Enable the OAuth 2 implicit grant for your application by choosing **Manifest** at the top of the application's page. Open the inline manifest editor.
   Search for the ``oauth2AllowImplicitFlow`` property. You will find that it is set to ``false``; change it to ``true`` and click on **Save** to save the manifest.
1. Then click on **Settings**, and choose **Properties**.
1. For the App ID URI, replace the guid in the generated URI 'https://\<your_tenant_name\>/\<guid\>', with the name of your service, for example, 'https://\<your_tenant_name\>/TodoListSPA-OBO' (replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant)
1. Configure Permissions for your application. To that extent, in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section and then,
   click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and type `TodoListService-OBO` in the textbox. Then, click on  **Select Permissions** and select **Access 'TodoListService-OBO'**.

#### Configure known client applications for service (TodoListService-OBO)

For the middle tier web API (`TodoListService-OBO`) to be able to call the downstream web APIs, the user must grant the middle tier permission to do so in the form of consent.
However, since the middle tier has no interactive UI of its own, you need to explicitly bind the client app registration in Azure AD, with the registration for the web API.
This binding merges the consent required by both the client & middle tier into a single dialog, which will be presented to the user by the client.
You can do so by adding the "Client ID" of the client app, to the manifest of the web API in the `knownClientApplications` property. Here's how:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your `TodoListService-OBO` app registration, and open the manifest editor by clicking on **Manifest**.
1. In the manifest, locate the `knownClientApplications` array property, and add the
   Client ID of the client application (`TodoListClient-OBO`) as an element.
   After you're done, your code should look like the following snippet with as many GUIDs as you have clients:
   `"knownClientApplications": ["94da0930-763f-45c7-8d26-04d5938baab2"]`
1. Save the TodoListService manifest by clicking the **Save** button.

1. [Optionally] do the same with the ClientID of your single page JavaScript application's registration if you created it.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, ClientID is the same as Application ID or AppId.

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the service project

1. Open the `TodoListService\Web.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the existing value with your AAD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ida:Audience` and replace the existing value with the App ID URI you registered earlier for the TodoListService-OBO app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService-OBO`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Find the app key `ida:AppKey` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `TodoListService-OBO` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ida:ClientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `TodoListService-OBO` application copied from the Azure portal.

#### Configure the client project

1. Open the `TodoListClient\App.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the existing value with your AAD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `TodoListClient-OBO` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ida:RedirectUri` and replace the existing value with the Redirect URI for TodoListClient-OBO app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListClient-OBO`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Find the app key `todo:TodoListResourceId` and replace the existing value with the App ID URI you registered earlier for the TodoListService-OBO app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService-OBO`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Find the app key `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the existing value with the base address of the TodoListService-OBO project (by default `https://localhost:44321/`).

#### [Optionally] Configure the TodoListSPA project

If you have configured the TodoListSPA application in Azure AD, you want to update the JavaScript project:

1. Open the `TodoListSPA\appconfig.js` file
2. In the `config`variable (which is about the Azure AD TodoListSPA configuration):

- find the member named `tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
- find the member named `clientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListSPA application from the Azure portal.
- find the member named `redirectUri` and replace the value with the redirect URI you provided for the TodoListSPA application from the Azure portal, for example, `https://localhost:44377/`.

3. In the `WebApiConfig`variable (which is about configuration of the resource, that is the TodoListService):

   - find the member named `resourceId` and replace the value with the  App ID URI of the TodoListService, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.

4. While running the SPA app in the browser, take care to allow popups from this app.

### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it. You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects, or the three projects, as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

Explore the sample by signing in, adding items to the To Do list, Clearing the cache (which removes the user account), and starting again.  The To Do list service will take the user's access token, received from the client, and use it to get another access token so it can act On Behalf Of the user in the Microsoft Graph API.  This sample caches the user's access token at the To Do list service, so it does not request a new access token on every request. This cache is a database cache.

[Optionally], when you have added a few items with the TodoList Client, login to the todoListSPA with the same credentials as the todoListClient, and observe the id-Token, and the content of the Todo List as stored on the service, but as Json. This will help you understand the information circulating on the network.

## About the code

The code using ADAL.NET is in the [TodoListClient/MainWindow.xaml.cs](TodoListClient/MainWindow.xaml.cs) file in the `SignIn()` method. See [More information][#More-information] below for details on how this work. The call to the TodoListService is done in the `AddTodoItem()` method.

The code for the Token cache serialization on the client side (in a file) is in [TodoListClient/FileCache.cs](TodoListClient/FileCache.cs)

The code acquiring a token on behalf of the user from the service side is in [TodoListService/Controllers/TodoListController.cs](TodoListService/Controllers/TodoListController.cs)

The code for the Service side serialization (in a database) is in [TodoListService/DAL/DbTokenCache.cs](TodoListService/DAL/DbTokenCache.cs). you can see how it's referenced by the Controller in the [CallGraphAPIOnBehalfOfUser()](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-onbehalfof/blob/49ddb0a47018db1d1cc2c397341bdc2331bcb502/TodoListService/Controllers/TodoListController.cs#L154) method.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has two WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

## How To Recreate This Sample

First, in Visual Studio 2017 create an empty solution to host the  projects. Then, follow these steps to create each project.

### Creating the TodoListService Project

1. In Visual Studio 2017, create a new `Visual C#` `ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)` project. In the next screen, choose the `Web API` project template.  And while on this screen, click the Change Authentication button, select 'Work or School Accounts', 'Cloud - Single Organization', enter the name of your Azure AD tenant.  You will be prompted to sign in to your Azure AD tenant.  NOTE:  You must sign in with a user that is in the tenant; you cannot, during this step, sign in with a Microsoft account.
2. Add the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, EntityFramework, and Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors to the project.
3. Add reference of the `System.IdentityModel` assembly in the project.
4. In the `Models` folder, add a new class called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the implementation of TodoItem from this sample into the class.
5. In the `Models` folder, add a new class called `UserProfile.cs`.  Copy the implementation of UserProfile from this sample into the class.
6. Create a new folder named `DAL`.In the `DAL` folder, add a new class called `DbTokenCache.cs`.  Copy the implementation of DbTokenCache from this sample into the class.
7. In the `DAL` folder, add a new class called `TodoListServiceContext.cs`.  Copy the implementation of TodoListServiceContext from this sample into the class.
8. Add a new class named `Extensions` in the project. Replace the implementation with the contents of the file of the same name from the sample.
9. Add a new, empty, Web API 2 Controller called `TodoListController`.
10. Copy the implementation of the TodoListController from this sample into the controller.  Don't forget to add the `[Authorize]` attribute to the class.
11. In `web.config` make sure that the key `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientID`, and `ida:AppKey` exist, and are populated.  For the global Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.onmicrosoft.com/{0}`.
12. In `web.config`, in `<appSettings>`, create keys for `ida:GraphResourceId` and `ida:GraphUserUrl` and set the values accordingly.  For the global Azure AD, the value of `ida:GraphResourceId` is `https://graph.microsoft.com`, and the value of `ida:GraphUserUrl` is `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/`.

### Creating the TodoListClient Project

1. In the solution, create a new Windows --> Windows Classic Desktop -> WPF App(.NET Framework)  called TodoListClient.
2. Add the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory to the project.
3. Add  assembly references to `System.Net.Http`, `System.Web.Extensions`, and `System.Configuration`.
4. Add a new class to the project called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of the same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
5. Add a new class to the project called `FileCache.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of the same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
6. Copy the markup from `MainWindow.xaml' in the sample project into the file of the same name in the new project, completely replacing the markup in the file in the new project.
7. Copy the code from `MainWindow.xaml.cs` in the sample project into the file of the same name in the new project, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
8. In `app.config` create keys for `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientId`, `ida:RedirectUri`, `todo:TodoListResourceId`, and `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and set them accordingly.  For the global Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.onmicrosoft.com/{0}`.

Finally, in the properties of the solution itself, set both projects as startup projects.
